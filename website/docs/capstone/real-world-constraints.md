# Real-World Constraints

## Learning Objectives

- Identify physical world constraints on humanoids
- Plan for failure modes and recovery
- Ensure safety in autonomous operation

## Prerequisites

- Read: [Design Tradeoffs](./design-tradeoffs)

## Key Constraints

### Battery Life (1-4 hours)
### Terrain Variability
### Dynamic Environments (people, moving objects)
### Weather and Lighting

## System Connectivity

Next: [Future Directions](./future-directions)
