# Hardware & Lab Architecture Summary

## Learning Objectives Achieved

- Compare workstation vs edge compute (Jetson)
- Understand sensor types and applications
- Evaluate on-prem vs cloud lab architectures

## Key Concepts

1. **Compute**: Workstations (GPU heavy) vs Jetson (embedded, power-efficient)
2. **Sensors**: Vision, LiDAR, IMU, tactile for perception
3. **On-Prem Labs**: High CapEx, low latency, full control
4. **Cloud Labs**: Elastic scaling, OpEx model, network dependent

## Next Steps

Proceed to [Sim-to-Real Challenges](../sim-to-real/domain-randomization)
