# Sim-to-Real Challenges - Summary

## Learning Objectives Achieved

- Understand domain randomization techniques
- Identify sources of reality gap
- Apply transfer learning from simulation to reality
- Address deployment constraints and safety

## Key Concepts

1. **Domain Randomization**: Vary simulation parameters for robustness
2. **Reality Gap**: Physics, sensor, and actuator discrepancies
3. **Transfer Learning**: Fine-tune sim policies with real-world data
4. **Deployment Constraints**: Latency, power, safety, regulation

## Next Steps

Proceed to [Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid System](../capstone/autonomous-humanoid-system)
