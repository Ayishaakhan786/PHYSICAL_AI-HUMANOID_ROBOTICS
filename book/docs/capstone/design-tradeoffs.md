# Design Tradeoffs

## Learning Objectives

- Analyze key tradeoffs in autonomous humanoid design
- Balance cost, performance, and reliability
- Justify design decisions for different use cases

## Prerequisites

- Read: [End-to-End Pipeline](./end-to-end-pipeline)

## Tradeoff Categories

### Latency vs Accuracy
### Power vs Performance
### Cost vs Capability
### Safety vs Efficiency

## System Connectivity

Next: [Real-World Constraints](./real-world-constraints)
