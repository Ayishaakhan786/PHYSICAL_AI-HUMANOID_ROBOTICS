# Workstations and Jetson

## Learning Objectives

- Compare workstation vs edge device requirements
- Understand Jetson platform for robotics
- Choose appropriate compute for different use cases

## Prerequisites

- Read: [Module 6: Humanoid Robotics](../modules/module-6-humanoid/humanoid-kinematics)

## Compute Comparison
